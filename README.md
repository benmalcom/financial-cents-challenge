This is the repo for The financial cents challenge, scaffolded with Vite, build with vue3 and tailwindcss.

## Project Setup

npm install
```

```
Project running on [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/)

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
``` 

### Design decisions & thoughts
* Project was done with Vue3 and Tailwindcss
* The availability of a design file (e.g figma file) instead of an image would've guaranteed a more pixel-perfect translation.
* Added some couple of tests
* Added loading skeletons for loading state
